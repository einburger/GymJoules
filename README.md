JoulesGym is a fitness app using React Native with three purposes:
- calculate expended energy of a certain exercise by using biological data and specifically tailored formulas (optional)
- keep a journal of workouts done each day
- track strength progress and calculate other statistical information

Some other ideas (WIP):
- create weekly workout plans
