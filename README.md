##### JoulesGym is a fitness app with three purposes:
1. calculate expended energy of a certain exercise by using biological data and specifically tailored formulas (optional)
2. keep a journal of workouts done each day
3. track strength progress and calculate other statistical information
---
##### Some other ideas (WIP):
1. create weekly workout plans

##### TODO:
- [x] create home screen
- [x] create exercise selection screen
- [x] enable screen navigation
- [ ] create exercise summary screen of user selected data
- [ ] create dialog box that allows user to input number of sets and reps of selected exercise
- [ ] create biological data input option (an optional thing)
- [ ] enable transfer of user input to other screens that rely on them
- [ ] implement some type of database to store previous selections
- [ ] create a calendar to view previous days
- [ ] create backend for energy calculations
